## Hello ðŸŒ¸

I am Aino (she/they), a soon-to-be software engineer who's currently studying at 42 Network's <a href="https://www.hive.fi/en/">Hive Helsinki.</a>

I started coding from literal scratch with no prior experience in July 2024, when I took part in the selection process, "Piscine".
I'm currently learning C, with a couple of projects under my belt - more on those in my repos.

I'm currently working on the project minishell, which is about creating a minimalist version of shell.

You can contact me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aino-havu-582579122/">LinkedIn</a> ðŸŒ»
