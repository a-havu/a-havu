## Hello ðŸŒ¸

I am Aino (she/they), a soon-to-be software engineer who's currently studying at 42 Network's <a href="https://www.hive.fi/en/">Hive Helsinki.</a>

I started coding from literal scratch with no experience in July 2024, when I took part in the selection process, "Piscine".
I'm currently learning C, with a couple of projects under my belt:

<a href="https://github.com/a-havu/libft">Libft</a>, the first project in a 42 school - create your own function library.
The next projects, <a href="https://github.com/a-havu/ft_printf">ft_printf</a> and <a href="https://github.com/a-havu/get_next_line">get_next_line</a> I have added to my Libft, so they travel with me from project to project.


You can contact me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aino-havu-582579122/">LinkedIn</a> ðŸŒ»
