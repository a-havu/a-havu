## Hello ðŸŒ¸

I am Aino (she/they), a soon-to-be software engineer who's currently studying at 42 Network's <a href="https://www.hive.fi/en/">Hive Helsinki.</a>

I started coding from literal scratch with no experience in July 2024, when I took part in the selection process, "Piscine".
I'm currently learning C, with a couple of projects under my belt:

ðŸŒŸ<a href="https://github.com/a-havu/libft">Libft</a>, the first project in a 42 school - create your own function library.
<br>The following projects, <a href="https://github.com/a-havu/ft_printf">ft_printf</a> and <a href="https://github.com/a-havu/get_next_line">get_next_line</a> I have added to my Libft, so they travel with me from project to project.

ðŸ”€<a href="https://github.com/a-havu/push_swap">push_swap</a>, a sorting algorithm where the challenge was to optimize the project for as few moves as possible.

ðŸ¦‡<a href="https://github.com/a-havu/so_long">so_long</a>, a simple 2D game where a hungry vampire needs to feed before going to slumber...

I'm currently working on the project Philosophers, a multi-threading algorithm!
